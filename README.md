Gun Violence in the United States: City-Level Analysis (2013–2018)

This project analyzes a dataset from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA)
, which provides free public access to accurate information about gun-related violence in the United States. I obtained the dataset from Kaggle.

The goal of this project was to answer two simple questions:

Which cities have had the most murders?

What does that trend look like on a yearly basis?

📊 Dataset

Source: Gun Violence Archive (via Kaggle)


Limitations:

Data for 2018 is incomplete since the dataset was uploaded mid-year.


🔎 Methods

Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Analysis steps:

Cleaned and pre-processed the raw data.

Created a bar chart showing the cities with the highest number of murders.

Created a time series plot showing yearly murder trends in selected cities.
