# Gun Violence in U.S. Cities 🔫

## An analysis of which U.S. cities experienced the most murders and how those trends evolved over time.


## 📖 Project Overview

This project uses data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA)
, accessed through Kaggle, to explore patterns of gun-related murders across U.S. cities. With this dataset, I wanted to answer two simple questions:

- Which cities have had the most murders?

- What do those yearly trends look like?

## 📊 Dataset

Source: Gun Violence Archive (via Kaggle)

Limitations:

- Data begins in 2013 and ends mid 2018. 2018 is incomplete, as the dataset was uploaded mid-year.


## 🛠️ Methods

- Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Steps:

- Cleaned and pre-processed raw GVA data.

- Built a bar plot showing which cities had the most murders.

- Built a time series plot to visualize yearly murder trends.

## 📈 Results

- Cities such as Chicago, Baltimore, and Houston consistently ranked highest in total murders.

- Yearly trends showed fluctuations across time
