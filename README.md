# Gun Violence in U.S. Cities 🔫

## An analysis of which U.S. cities experienced the most murders and how those trends evolved over time.


## 📖 Project Overview

This project uses data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA)
, accessed through Kaggle, to explore patterns of gun-related murders across U.S. cities. With this dataset, I wanted to answer two simple questions:

- Which cities have had the most murders?

- What do those yearly trends look like?

## 📊 Dataset

Source: Gun Violence Archive (via Kaggle)

Limitations:

- Data begins in 2013 and ends mid 2018. 2018 is incomplete, as the dataset was uploaded mid-year.


## 🛠️ Methods

- Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Steps:

- Cleaned and pre-processed raw GVA data.

- Built a bar plot showing which cities had the most murders.

- Built a time series plot to visualize yearly murder trends.

## 📈 Results

- The analysis identified Chicago, Houston, Baltimore, St. Louis, Philadelphia and New Orleans as the top U.S. cities with the highest murder counts in this timeframe
- Chicago remained the deadliest city, peaking in 2016–2017, while Baltimore surged to second. St. Louis rose steadily, Philadelphia and Houston fluctuated with slight increases, and New Orleans was the only city to show a slight decline.
